The authors of the **ZhanLabData: Large Dataset of Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X-Ray Images** addressed challenges related to reliability and interpretability in the implementation of clinical-decision support algorithms for medical imaging. The **Chest XRay** part has a total of 5,856 patients contributed to the dataset, with 3,883 images characterized as depicting ***PNEUMONIA_BACTERIA***, ***PNEUMONIA_VIRUS*** and ***NORMAL*** images. They established a diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework specifically designed for the screening of patients with common treatable blinding retinal diseases.

The full dataset consists of the following parts:

- **ZhangLabData: OCT** (available on DatasetNinja)
- **ZhangLabData: Chest X-Ray** (current)


Authors' framework employed transfer learning, a technique that involves training a neural network with a fraction of the data used in conventional approaches. This approach was applied to a dataset of optical coherence tomography images, demonstrating performance comparable to that of human experts in classifying age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema.

In addition to achieving high performance, the authors focused on providing a more transparent and interpretable diagnosis. Their approach involved highlighting the regions recognized by the neural network, enhancing the understanding of the decision-making process.

To investigate the generalizability of their AI system, the authors extended the transfer learning framework to the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia. Highlighting the severity of pneumonia as a leading cause of childhood mortality, particularly in developing countries, they aimed to expedite the diagnosis and referral of these treatable conditions.

The authors emphasized the significance of accurate and timely diagnosis for pediatric pneumonia, a disease responsible for a substantial number of childhood deaths. They utilized chest X-ray images, a standard diagnostic tool, to train their AI system. The dataset comprised 5,232 chest X-ray images from children, including those depicting bacterial and viral pneumonia, as well as normal cases. The AI system demonstrated effectiveness in classifying pediatric chest X-rays to detect pneumonia, distinguishing between viral and bacterial pneumonia to facilitate rapid referrals for urgent intervention.
